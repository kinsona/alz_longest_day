                    Your experience moving your LO into a care center? Is there anything you&#39;d have done differently in hindsight?
                </div>

                <div class="bubble you">
                   If you&#39;ve been through this, how did you handle it with your loved one?  Are there any tips/techniques for making this transition easier on all involved?  Is there anything you didn&#39;t do but wish you had done?

                <div class="bubble me">
                    We didn&#39;t really have a plan for the first day.  Our friends were moving her furniture into her new room through the back door and I thought when they were done and the room was ready my dad and I were going to tell her together she was staying and not going home.  He thought I was doing it on my own.  I was unprepared to do it all by myself.
                </div>
                <div class="bubble me">
                    So I recommend you have a clear plan as to who&#39;s doing what, everything from moving her stuff in to making sure all her meds and care instructions are in place to who is actually saying good-bye - if you are planning to say good-bye - and what they are going to say.
